		<h1>Jerry Seinfeld</h1>

		<img src="img/seinfeld.jpeg">

		<p>Jerry Seinfeld is a stand-up comedian living in New York who is the level-headed leader amongst his group of three friends. His optimism allows him to avoid/ignore major life problems that his other friends cannot help but run into. Incredibly observant, Seinfeld has the uncanny ability to point out quirks about his friends' lives and present them in ways that are comical, albeit normally demeaning. He loves Superman, breaking up with girlfriends for silly reasons, and Pez, but hates Karl Farbman furniture, Kenny Rogers Chicken, and Newman. </p>

		<p>Jerry stars on the famous Sit-Com <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/seinfeld/">Seinfeld</a></p>
